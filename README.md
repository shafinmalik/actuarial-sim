# actuarial-sim

Welcome. This project aims to provide tools for generating synthetic insurance data, which can be used for practicing actuarial reserving techniques and other actuarial analyses.

## Overview

Currently, this repository includes a Python script that automatically generates a synthetic dataset for health insurance claims. This initial version focuses solely on generating a dataset for health plans. 

In the future, I plan to expand this repository to include codebases for generating synthetic datasets for other types of insurance, including:

- Auto Insurance
- Life Insurance
- Property and Casualty Insurance
- Potentially to more niche areas

## Installation

To use the script, simply clone this repository and run the Python script provided. Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/actuarial-sim.git
cd actuarial-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_health_data.py
